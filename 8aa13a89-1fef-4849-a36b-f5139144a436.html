<p>The government has won the cyber war. Their grasp chokes the citizens of every country as oppression rules the world. Then a group of hackers carved out an untraceable piece of cyberspace and created the underground network known as Neon Valley. Since then, it has become a place where both the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free. And such places always attract a need for entertainment, thus the Neon Valley Colosseum was born.</p>
<p>An online shooter inspired by retrowave and neo-80s. Neon Valley takes an arcade-like route to the shooter genre. With high score leaderboards based on both skill and style. Fast-paced combat akin to Quake and Unreal Tournament. Game modes such as floor is lava, obstacle courses and more. Neon Valley is a place where the best come to attain infamy and carve out their name in the cyberspace.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CaxNwULwhR5CYCe47ZyNjKJBeUYoHAQznJuGVK4hwZ-RgBM33L62u7PJMt3vGuCf6KzIA_0GQ3ThO2GD1FCK3yiBY20k077wzpeTRM2t7zbjqExDxjH6Rb2ABO0VldQXaqoOOuY" width="624" height="351" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The new frontier Neon Valley. A place free from the grips of the government, a place where humanity indulges. This is where black market trades are done, where secrets are shared and ideas, outlawed by the government, discussed. A world where the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7bm5dMRg6ZfzdgfHSOlQ-3pzed63NfvHxDFuIom2VcXZn8VeAN9HQP_JSPSRPphWuDr_UYe6nK1L0oF_Rt4hygx15aVNtblp05RZSpcpoxybuCyK7lwQv6C1i_JHO5S6VUha8xI" width="624" height="351" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>At the core of Neon Valley, the Colosseum exists. On the surface, it thrives as an entertainment complex. As challenges for skill junkies. As a platform to notoriety. But the Colosseum fuels this virtual world. It draws in new challengers all over the world and with this comes opportunity. The black market programmers use it to test virtual weapons. Dealers barter and wager on the outcome of battles. Designers display their latest fashion code. Map editors design intricate battlegrounds. At the center lies you. The user. Will you show the world what you’ve got?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5CqhqM6SLoFrtqTqPCeFLVEe-3hXWmGstDfrWtEqwrJKCiArmrTZlBO5xyzhComr_3SMZ-kUbrAzACY74jfkC8xU-aIOcMEMRDx_PiqpMi6asFqWkC86go-AnqDaC5q6jJaQZmQ" width="624" height="351" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This is a place of entertainment where most come to conquer the battlegrounds. To prove their skills above all others in the new frontier and obtain infamy. For some of our ambitions never fade through the ages. However, behind the Colosseum and the city is a network of shadows who control its affairs. Some support the rebellion from the shadows... Others profit off the market and guide its very design. Their whims might be in your benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Battle suit</strong></p>
<p>Here users compete with Battle Suits. A program interface which a user takes control of, giving them freedom of movement and an assortment of items. Items which they take onto the field for offensive and defensive purposes. Users battle to unlock new gear, increasing their prowess on the battlegrounds, climbing to reach the top of the leaderboards.</p>

<p><strong>Movement</strong></p>
<p>Your suit has full range of motion using “WASD” inputs. Each suit has the ability of partial air control, adjusting your trajectory mid-air. This also includes sprinting state activated with “Shift”. Crouching state with “C” input, for taking cover behind low objects and a smaller attack profile. Eventually for better shooting accuracy and going under obstacles too. Also, stealth option with the newly added foliage. It’s also the state you enter after performing a slide maneuver.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sliding&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Talking about slide maneuver, sliding is patched in. Activating crouch whilst in motion will perform a slide. While sprinting the battle suit does a short dash, followed by an extended slide. Sliding in air, it slightly increases user down velocity, to mimic a shinobi air dash move inspired by ninjas.</p>

<p><strong>Dashing</strong></p>
<p>Expending stamina/energy to dash allows the user to increase directional acceleration of the battle suit using small boosters attached to the lower back. This booster is used to avoid enemy attacks, dashing onto areas just out of reach and general evasion or positioning.</p>

<p><strong>Shields</strong></p>
<p>Each battle suit has a forcefield as the first layer of defense. Take cover when it breaks to regenerate or risk taking damage to your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stamina</strong></p>
<p>Yes, stamina is simulated in this virtual world. Something to limit the freedom of movement and create opportunities for entertaining situations. Dashing, sliding, sprinting and wall jumps consume stamina. However, it will regenerate given some cool down time.</p>

<p><strong>Camera controls</strong></p>
<p>Each battle suit is fitted with a small drone camera to provide a wider perspective for better spatial awareness. You can activate toggle this camera with Q. Your visor and drone camera are designed with adaptive magnification built in. Allowing the user to freely zoom with or without weapons fitted with scopes.</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder switch</strong></p>
<p>Use “Z” to switch shoulders in 3rd person. This will move the default shoulder position of the drone camera to the other shoulder. Useful in peeking around corners, better bullet trajectory for tight angles and also for user preference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alt&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hold “Alt” to look around with the camera. In 3rd person this will rotate the camera around the user. Basically, allowing the user to easily surveil their surroundings or to check themselves out.</p>

<p><strong>Dual wield</strong></p>
<p>The largest change to guns. Secondary weapons can now be equipped dual wield. Even though it replaces the primary weapon slot, the idea is that a dual wielded weapon has the same power and perhaps more versatility than a primary weapon. Giving users this option is part of the game design philosophy of allowing users to fully customize their gear according to a playstyle they wish.</p>
<p><strong>Melee weapon - Primary weapon sub-class</strong></p>
<p>Added the slide for a reason. To increase the ninja-like game feel, the long awaited Ninjato sword has been added. The first of the melee weapons. Still working out fluidity kinks, motion and better collision detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ninjato has a 4 attack types:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QN62_1r6lcLt4TBTv7oejD40t4RO1P7bxEZwFXhK5yf8giwuJ-uArSpkuzX83jnCLbSEG9BoHYTYNqXzi-phkIFclYhyt3yR1S3V0QNBxSMH11QZ6SZPhMXbwCxMqeLSK_sfOig" width="624" height="351" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>High &amp; low</p>
<p>High attacks, using Left Mouse input, the user dashes towards looking direction and this attack has 3 moves in its combo. Low attacks uses the Right Mouse input and the user performs a slide motion whilst slashing in a 3 move combo too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ajN93-qpqveXc2qCPgg7y8R5kbEIclun0sjEGBjFXK6rnB7SK7kSEwHUiFeBH5-pW9iGMZ0OjrwH0Dwb3mrFdHBj1D0KBQ6rvybu_hvsd_JFD24TeIbnpfS7sd3B8nsMERaJAFQ" width="624" height="351" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px" loading="lazy"></strong></p>
<p>High and Low attacks can be interchanged to perform different combos. For example, R + L + R will perform a high, low, high attack chain. Attacks have a movement multiplier according to movement input. Holding forward, attacks lunge further as gap closers to reach gun users. When holding backwards, attacks are performed on the spot.</p>

<p>Jump</p>
<p>The jump attack gives the user a double jump, essentially. At the apex of the double jump the user attacks, reaching targets with the height advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Slide</p>
<p>While in sliding motion there is a small window to attack, which triggers a slide attack. Shortly dashing the user forward whilst simultaneously slicing vertically, the user can quickly reach an enemy and damages everything along the dashing path.</p>

<p><strong>Gadgets</strong></p>
<p>Each gadget has a certain utility and mostly defense oriented. Designed by the River dragon these tools are locked behind the blue multipass. Various shields for defense, or get creative and use them as platforms. A pulse clear which absorbs all incoming bullets akin to bullet hell games. Lastly, a gravity multiplier which grounds any object in its range and stuns enemies. Apply these limited ammo items in the right situation to triumph.</p>
<p><strong>Nades - Gadget sub-class</strong></p>
<p>There are four grenades in the users arsenal. Vision distortion, teleportation, explosive and a force push sticky nade. Each has their own advantages.</p>

<p><strong>Movement gadget - Gadget sub-class</strong></p>
<p>Rapid terrain traversal gadgets, which are perfect for repositioning and moving over obstacles. A booster pack which propels the user where they are aiming, designed to be the most agile of the movement gadgets. The grapple hook moves the user the furthest but at the cost of telegraphing their movements. Lastly, the newly added boost pad. A gadget which can be used offensively as well, setting a trap for enemies and launching them away from you… Or into a vulnerable position.</p>
