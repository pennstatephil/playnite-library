					<h2>This game is not what it seems...</h2>
<p>Baldi's Basics™ Plus is an active stealth roguelike that parodies cheap '90s edutainment with a subtle horror twist! Try to collect all the notebooks in each level as Baldi uses his incredible hearing to track you down in a game of "Hide &amp; Seek". As you do so you will encounter strange characters, find useful items, go on field trips and more inside Baldi’s ever changing Super Schoolhouse, and as you explore the game itself you'll start to realize it is not what it seems...</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Fight chaos with strategy!</h2>
<p>Mixing strategy with chaos, Baldi's Basics Plus plays like no other game, with surprises around every corner that will throw your plans for a loop. Strategizing is key, but knowing how to best revise those strategies as situations change is even more important! As you learn the ins-and-outs of every character, item, event, and obstacle, you'll be able to make better plans, come up with the best strategies, and escape the most dangerous situations.</p>
<h2>Near infinite replayability</h2>
<p>Baldi's Basics Plus randomizes so many different things, every time you play will be a different experience!</p>
<ul><li>Procedurally generated levels - The levels change every time you play! Not only will the layout change, but the types of rooms and obstacles you find will change too.<br>
</li><li>Random events - One moment everything is fine, the next the school is flooding, or flips upside down! Random events can begin at any moment, keeping you on your toes.<br>
</li><li>Mixing and matching characters - Each time you play, you'll encounter a random combination of characters, each one having their own unique behavior. When different characters collide, they may create unique situations!
</li></ul>
<p>All these variables and more add up to make each playthrough a unique experience!</p>
<h2>Lots of ways to play</h2>
<p>Baldi's Basics Plus features many different modes to test players in different ways!</p>
<ul><li>Hide &amp; Seek - Avoid Baldi as you complete a series of randomly generated levels! Run out of lives and you'll have to start over from the beginning. Beat them all in one go to win! Currently, Hide &amp; Seek has you play through&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;randomly generated levels of increasing difficulty, with more planned to be added.<br>
</li><li>Endless Mode - See how many notebooks you can collect before being caught by Baldi! Compete by playing on pre-made levels, or go crazy and try playing on a randomly generated one. Currently, there is&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;pre-made map and&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;type of randomly generated map to choose from, with plans to add more.<br>
</li><li>Field Trips - Play field trip minigames found in Hide &amp; Seek whenever you like! You can try to set high scores, or just practice. Currently there are <strong>2</strong> field trip minigames available, with plans to add more.<br>
</li><li>Challenge Mode (PLANNED FOR LATER IN DEVELOPMENT) - As you make new discoveries in Hide &amp; Seek, you'll unlock challenges! Challenges offer unique scenarios you won't find in the main game. One might have you sneaking around the school to avoid being seen by the Principal of the Thing, another might have both you and Baldi running at super high speeds! Currently, there are&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;challenge maps in the game for legacy purposes, with plans to add many all new and improved challenges when the game is nearing completion.</li></ul>
<h2>Early access info</h2>
<p>Baldi's Basics Plus is an early access title.&nbsp;This means you will can buy and play the game, but it isn't finished yet!&nbsp;As such you can expect to encounter some bugs, and there will be some missing features for a while. However, you will also receive all future updates for free and get to be a part of the game's development! Check out the FAQ below for more info.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h3>Why Early Access?</h3>
<p><em>“With how long it is taking to complete this project, I decided to make it available in early access as the core of the game is already very fun and highly repayable. This way people can enjoy the game now and offer feedback as development progresses.”</em><br></p>
<h3>Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?</h3>
<p><em>“I have no estimate to give at this time. My plan is to release a major update approximately every two months for the foreseeable future, each one containing whatever new content is completed and ready to be released. This will continue until a point where the game is close enough to completion that I will want to stop early access updates to focus all my resources on wrapping up the project. This means that there will be a sizeable gap between the last early access update and the 1.0 update, but I will continue to keep everyone updated on what's going on during that time.”</em><br></p>
<h3>How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?</h3>
<p><em>“The biggest difference will be that the finished version of the game will contain a lot more polish, secrets, and story elements/context. Many aspects of the game that currently feel unfinished, such as the menus, will be significantly improved in the final version. The story I have planned will also remain completely absent from the early access. This story will be relatively unobtrusive, so anyone who's interested solely in the gameplay will not have to worry about it getting in the way. My focus is making a fun game first, cool story second.”</em><br></p>
<h3>What is the current state of the Early Access version?</h3>
<p><em>“As of version 0.4 released in February 2024, the game is in a very playable state, specifically the main Hide &amp; Seek mode. This update brought a lot of technical changes that paved the way for smoother development and my plans for the rest of development.</em><br><br><em>Features that are currently implemented include:</em></p>
<ul><li><em>Hide and Seek (The game's main mode), which requires the player to beat a series of randomly generated levels. (Currently has three levels to beat, more are planned)<br>
</em></li><li><em>Endless Mode<br>
</em></li><li><em>Field Trips&nbsp;(Currently there are two field trip minigames, more are planned)<br>
</em></li><li><em>Challenge Mode (Currently there are three old challenge maps available for legacy purposes, more are planned to be added near the end of development)<br>
</em></li><li><em>Custom NPC AI (Currently there are 13 fully functional NPCs, more are planned)<br>
</em></li><li><em>Procedural level generation<br>
</em></li><li><em>Random events (Currently there are seven, more are planned)</em></li><li><em>"Educational" activities, which are very short puzzles or mini-games that must be completed to collect notebooks in some modes. (Currently, there is one, more are planned)<br>
</em></li><li><em>Custom lighting system<br>
</em></li><li><em>In-game shop where you can purchase items between levels<br>
</em></li><li><em>Save and continue system which allows you to quit in the middle of a game of Hide and Seek and then continue later where you left off.<br>
</em></li><li><em>A sound propagation system that forces sound to travel around walls in a relatively realistic way.
</em></li></ul>
<p><em>Planned features that are not yet implemented include:</em></p>
<ul><li><em>Secret levels<br>

<h3>Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?</h3>
<p><em>“Yes, when the game leaves early access the price will be increased.”</em><br></p>
<h3>How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?</h3>
<p><em>“Player feedback is very important to me and has and will continue to be a very important part of the development process. It is particularly helpful for getting game balance right, something that I will be tweaking constantly until the very end of development. If you have any feedback at all, please let me know in the Steam discussions or an email!”</em></p>
